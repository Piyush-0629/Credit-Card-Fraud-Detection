# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project is a Credit Card Fraud Detection system that can be used to classify whether a transaction is fraudulant or valid. The project is made using Python and Machine Learning. 

Conducte an in-depth analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Implementes and compared multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines, to identify the most suitable algorithm for the task. I trained the models using the preprocessed dataset and fine-tuned their hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.

**Project Goals**:

The goal was to build a model that could accurately classify fraudulent credit card transactions, thereby helping financial institutions detect and prevent fraudulent activities.



**Results**:

•Successfully developed a credit card fraud detection system that demonstrated strong performance in accurately classifying fraudulent transactions. 

•The model achieved a high detection rate while maintaining a low false positive rate, thus minimizing the impact on genuine transactions.


## Tech Stack and Skill

•Proficiency in Python programming for machine learning tasks.

•Knowledge of various machine learning algorithms and their application in real-world scenarios.

•Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques.

•Understanding of performance metrics and their interpretation.
